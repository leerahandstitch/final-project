<p class="description">Lyra Tan is a fabulous, euthusiastic, creative sixteen-year old girl from Hong Kong (though she also calls New York City, Palo Alto and Manila "home"). Her pet peeves include people mispronouncing her name, rude people at the theatre and drivers that don't understand the rules of the road. She loves every Broadway musical known to man (especially Newsies), any actor or actress who has made an appearance in a musical, Disney in all of its forms, all things cuddly and soft and, of course, her amazing family and friends. Her hobbies include singing and acting on stage, dancing alone in her room, performing one-man shows for her family in the living room and finding new musicals to obsess over. Her dream is to spend the rest of her life completely fulfilled - and, hopefully, still involved in musical theater. Oh, and there must be good food around too.</p>
<p class="description">Lyra was clearly meant to rock the Broadway stage! </p>
