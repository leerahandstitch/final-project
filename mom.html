<p class="description">Anna Tan is a fabulous, well-organized, fashionable and incredibly wise mother of two lovely human children, a dog child and wife to Eugene Tan. Her hobbies include hiking in Tai Tam Country Park with her dog, arranging flowers, taking pictures of beautiful moments on her iPhone, praying the rosary, being with people who care about her and telling stories. She loves Sunday dim sum, Barry Manilow, good books, old movies, cooking and baking and her infamous scarves that can complete any look. Anna is extremely passionate about everything that she does, whether it is flower arranging at church or Facebooking family pictures or discussing interesting topics at the dinner table. If it has to be done, it has to be done well!</p>
<p class="description">Anna is truly a super mom! </p>
