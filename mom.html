<p class="description">Anna Tan is a fabulous, well-organized, fashionable and incredibly intelligent mother of two lovely children and wife to Eugene Tan. Her hobbies include hiking in Tai Tam Country Park, arranging flowers, listening to Rick Astley in the car, finding good deals on cute clothes and cooking and baking the most amazing creations. She loves Inside-Out carrot cake cookies from Trader Joe's, Sunday dim sum, Barry Manilow, scarves, sunglasses, Marc Jacobs' handbags, shopping and experimenting with makeup. Basically, Anna always loves to look good. Anna is always there to nurse, care for, love, hug and give advice to her children whenever they need her, which obviously makes her the best momma in the world, and her two kids (and husband and puppy) love her so very, very much for that.</p>
<p class="description">Anna is truly a super mom! </p>
