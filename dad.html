<p class="description">Eugene Tan is a fabulous, very intelligent, strong and wise father of two and husband to Anna Tan! He has many great accomplishments to his name, including his MBA from Stanford University, but there's so much more to him than his degrees and his job posiitons. Eugene is an amazing father who puts so much time into being with his family - whether it's taking his wife out on dates, helping his son with writing his resume or assisting his daughter in studying for her AP tests! He is the most patient father and husband there is, and no one can compare to his amazing skills. Even when the other members of the family are screaming and yelling at each other about something incredibly stupid and absolutely inane, Eugene manages to stay calm and acts as the most solid pedestal for the entire family's foundation. He is like an ox - slow, but steady and always there.</p>
<p class="description">Thank heavens for Eugene!</p>
